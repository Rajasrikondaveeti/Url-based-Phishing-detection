# Url-based-Phishing-detection
Phishing URL-based cyberattack detection is proposed in this study to prevent crime and protect people’s privacy. 
 • The dataset consists of 11000+ phishing URL attributes that help classify phishing URLs based on these attributes. 
 • Machine learning models have been applied, such as decision tree (DT), linear regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), support vector classifier (SVC), K-Neighbors classifier (KNN), which can accurately classify the threats of phishing URLs.
 In proposed method we extent new method with cat boost classifier to improve accuracy.
